I finally got some time to take a closer look at the dungeon related notes @End#3983 and @UsernameFodder#0368 have provided! There really are great! 
I think I'll change my plans and add dungeon editing into SkyTemple next, because this is really motivating!

End, you wrote you weren't sure how the game knows which scripts to load after leaving a dungeon.
The game always fires up the script coroutine EVENT_DIVDIE when switching from Dungeon mode to Ground

START
SCRIPT_D01P11B_m01a0208.ssb.exps:

Part of coroutine EVENT_M01_01_02 (last script)

dungeon_mode(1) = DMODE_OPEN;
main_EnterDungeon(1, 0);
switch ( message_Menu(MENU_DUNGEON_RESULT) ) { }
main_EnterDungeon(-1, 0);
hold;
end;

DEFEAT:
coroutine EVENT_M01_03:
SCRIPT_D01P11B_m01a0301.ssb.exps
defeated.

START and DEFEAT
controlled by EVENT_DIVIDE_FIRST.

If SCENARIO_MAIN[0] is 2. If SCENARIO_MAIN[1] is 0, EVENT_M01_01_02 is played. If it is 2 or 3 the EVENT_M01_03 is played.


SUCCESS:
coroutine EVENT_M01_07_08.
GETOUT_SCENARIO_DUNGEON: When GROUND_START_MODE is 8 and DUNGEON_ENTER is 2.

EVENT_M01_04 before boss fight.
EVENT_M01_05 before boss fight if fained first.
-> GETOUT_SCENARIO_DUNGEON: When GROUND_START_MODE is 8 and DUNGEON_ENTER is 1.
-> If SCENARIO_MAIN == 2,2 then M01_04, if SCENARIO_MAIN == 2,3 then M01_05.
